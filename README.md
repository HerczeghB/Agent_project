# AI Weather & Calculator Agent

## Project Description

This project is a simple AI agent with two main functionalities:
1.  It can retrieve the current weather conditions for a specified city.
2.  It includes a built-in calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

This project is currently in its early stages of development.

## Current Functionality

* **Weather Search:** The agent can be provided with a city name to fetch and display the current weather information using OpenWeather API(https://openweathermap.org/).
* **Calculator:** The agent can perform calculations.

## Future Implementations

The following features are planned for future development:

* **Enhanced Geolocation:** The `find_location` function will be updated to use the [Geoapify API](https://www.geoapify.com/) for more accurate and robust location searching.
* **User Input for City:** A feature will be added to allow the user to be prompted to enter a city name, making the weather search interactive.
